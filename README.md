Secret Message Sharing App (2022)

Secret Message Sharing App is the project from "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course" by Colt Steele & Stephen Grider.

The main idea was to create the app in which users could excange their own secret messages.

Through this project I learned about Materialize library + how to change Base64 code to ASCII.

Full app deployment to the open internet was done with using free service called Now + signing up to Vercel.
