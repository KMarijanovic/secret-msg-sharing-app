Secret Message Sharing App (2022)

Secret Message Sharing App is the project from "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course" by Colt Steele & Stephen Grider.

The main idea was to create the app in which users could excange their own secret messages. Through this project I learned about Materialize library + how to change Base64 code to ASCII. Full app deployment (one last step of creating processs) couldn't be finished with npx due to my old PC operative system Win7 so links can only be shared with "the creator" of the app = me (only by opening new tabs in browser), not with other users. This will be updated in due time.
